# CVWO Web Application

This is a web application created as part of the CVWO assignment. It features a frontend built with React and a backend powered by FastAPI. The application allows users to view logs, post in forums, and interact with prediction data.

## üåê Visit the Deployed Site
The application is live at:  
[https://cvwo-jerome.onrender.com/](https://cvwo-jerome.onrender.com/)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Cold Start
When viewing **Logs** and **Forums**, please wait around **1 minute** during cold startup. This delay is caused by the free-tier deployment on Render, which spins down the backend when idle.

---

## ‚ú® Features
### Logs
- View prediction logs with detailed data such as:
  - Ticker symbols
  - Log dates
  - Predictions (`Long` or `Short`) with visual arrows (blue for up, red for down)
  - AUC Scores
  - Outcome statuses
- Filter logs by ticker symbol and **AUC Score** threshold to focus on the most reliable predictions.

### Forums
- Create, update, and delete posts.
- Search posts by ticker symbol.
- User authentication for secure interactions.

## üîç Why Focus on AUC Score?
The **AUC Score (Area Under the Curve)** is a critical metric in evaluating the performance of machine learning classification models. It measures the ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative outcomes.

### Importance in This Application:
- AUC Score provides a measure of the **confidence** and **reliability** of predictions.
- Predictions with higher AUC Scores are more likely to be accurate and actionable.
- By allowing users to filter predictions using a **slider for AUC Score**, the application ensures that users can focus on the most reliable predictions tailored to their threshold of confidence.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
### Frontend
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Material-UI**: For UI components like sliders.
- **Axios**: For API calls.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for table and forum designs.

### Backend
- **FastAPI**: For building the RESTful API. (I know it isnt the guideline, but I had to learn WebDev from scratch and I believed it was better for me to learn and not just GPT all the backend)
- **SQLite**: Embedded database for storing logs, user data, and forum posts.
- **bcrypt**: For secure password hashing.
- **CORS Middleware**: To enable communication between the frontend and backend.

### Deployment
- **Frontend**: Deployed as a static site on [Render](https://render.com). The site serves React's optimized production build.
- **Backend**: Hosted on Render's free-tier infrastructure with persistent disk storage for the SQLite database.
- **Database**: SQLite database hosted on Render with persistent storage.

## üîÆ Prediction Generation
The predictions displayed in the Logs section are generated by a machine learning model developed in my other repository:  
[AISTOCK Repository](https://github.com/JeromeG89/AISTOCK.git)

This repository uses historical stock data, machine learning techniques, and feature engineering to provide predictions for stocks.

- Accessible at: [https://cvwo-jerome.onrender.com/](https://cvwo-jerome.onrender.com/).
- Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`.
- Publish Directory: `frontend/build`.

### Backend
- Deployed as a web service on Render.
- Accessible at: [https://cvwo-ai-stock.onrender.com/](https://cvwo-ai-stock.onrender.com/).
- Start Command: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`.
- Persistent Disk: Used for storing `database.db` to retain data across restarts.
